    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <p> The journey of <b>computers</b> and the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> has been one of the
        most <strong>transformative</strong> chapters in human history. From <u>mechanical devices</u>
        to modern-day <em>supercomputers</em>, this story combines science, mathematics, and imagination.
        In this article, we will explore the <mark>milestones</mark> that shaped technology as we know it. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus.
        Later, Charles Babbage proposed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the
        <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>. His work was enhanced by
        <em>Ada Lovelace</em>, who wrote the first algorithm intended for a machine.
        These ideas laid the foundation of computing, although at the time, they seemed like
        <q>dreams too ambitious for the 19th century</q>. <br>
        Later, Alan Turing introduced the <abbr title="Universal Turing Machine">UTM</abbr>,
        a theoretical model of computation. His <mark>contributions</mark> continue to inspire
        computer science today.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p> Computers have evolved in distinct <i>generations</i>. The first generation relied on
        <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were bulky and unreliable. The second generation
        replaced them with <em>transistors</em>, reducing size and cost. By the third generation,
        <abbr title="Integrated Circuit">IC</abbr> technology was introduced, enabling more
        powerful machines. The fourth generation saw <b>microprocessors</b>, bringing computers
        into homes as <u>personal computers</u>. Today, the fifth generation includes
        <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <em>quantum computing</em>. <br>
        A famous mathematical formula related to computing is
        E = mc<sup>2</sup>, which shows the relationship between energy and mass.
        Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water, vital for cooling early
        <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> systems.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>The Internet was born from ARPANET, a project of the U.S. Department of Defense.
        Later, Tim Berners-Lee invented the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        and the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, creating the foundations of
        the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>. <br>
        As Berners-Lee once said: </p>
    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality.
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is
        an essential aspect."
        - <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p> This quote highlights the <mark>importance of inclusivity</mark> in technology.
        Early connections used <del>dial-up</del> but were later replaced by <ins>broadband</ins>
        and fiber optics. Today, we carry the Internet in our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>In the modern era, <em>computers</em> and the Internet are essential in nearly every
        aspect of life. We shop, learn, and even socialize online. <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
        is being integrated into daily applications, while <u>cloud computing</u> allows data
        storage across the world. <br>
        Researchers are also working on <strong>quantum computing</strong>, which uses
        <var>qbits</var> instead of classical bits. This represents a fundamental shift
        in how we process information.
    </p>

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p> To display text on a webpage, you can use the following HTML code:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        Another example of computer interaction: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>
        to copy text. <br>
        System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In summary, the <strong>history of computers and the Internet</strong> reflects
        humanity's constant pursuit of <em>innovation</em>. From the abacus to artificial
        intelligence, each step is a testament to <b>human creativity</b> and determination.
